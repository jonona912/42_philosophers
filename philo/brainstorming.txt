// Struct ===>
// create number of keys - array 1, 2, 3, 4
// create threads for each philosopher


// how to make sure that the order of thread creation goes in circles? 
// if the philosopher that just woke up opens before the one that was waiting
// create a stack/waitlist


// two or more philosophers thread function
// set the position of the philosopher - use mutex
// try to mute forks when the philosopher is in queue (loop while pos = queue)
//
